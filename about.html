          <p>Uganda Development and Health Associates (UDHA) started its operations as a Community Based Organization (CBO) in April of 2003 in the Iganga District. The organization has been involved in various community-based activities ever since, specializing in HIV/AIDS prevention, Malaria control, sanitation, adolescent sexual and reproductive health, and school health and immunization.</p>
          <p>In August of 2005, UDHA expanded its operations to the Mayuge and Bugiri Districts in a new capacity as a Non-Government Organization (NGO).</p>
          <p>The organization attracted a significant number of professionals in health, social work, law, agriculture, community development, education, and environment. These actions were appreciated as UDHA recognized that community problems are multi-causal and therefore require multi-sectoral approaches with strong community participation. UDHA improves access to services dedicated to enhancing and expanding healthcare for underserved communities. This often includes empowering young mothers and children using sustainable mechanisms. Since 2003, UDHA has become a regional role model in health promotion and has been even more committed to serving the poor and vulnerable in Uganda.</p>
